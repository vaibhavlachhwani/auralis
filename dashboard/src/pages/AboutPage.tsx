              <p>
                It all started with a simple, frustrating question that many of
                us have asked: "Why is my internet so slow right now?" My home
                network, once a simple setup, had evolved into a complex
                ecosystem of laptops, phones, smart TVs, and a dozen other IoT
                devices. One evening, everything ground to a halt. A critical
                file download was crawling, video calls were dropping, and
                online games were unplayable. The culprit was a mystery.
              </p>
              <p>
                My first instinct was to dive into command-line tools. I spent
                hours trying to piece together data from <code>ping</code>,
                <code> traceroute</code>, and <code>netstat</code>, but all I
                got were fragmented clues, not a clear picture. I felt like I
                was trying to solve a puzzle in the dark. On the other end of
                the spectrum were the enterprise-grade network monitoring
                solutionsâ€”powerful, but overwhelmingly complex and prohibitively
                expensive for a home or small business environment. They
                required dedicated servers, complex configurations, and a manual
                thick enough to be a doorstop.
              </p>
              <p>
                This experience sparked an idea: What if there was a better way?
                What if you could have the power of a professional tool with the
                simplicity of a consumer app? What if you could visualize your
                network's activity as easily as checking the weather?
              </p>
              <p className="text-foreground font-medium">
                That's why Auralis was born. The journey to create it was driven
                by a passion for elegant design and a belief that powerful
                technology should be accessible to everyone. The goal was to
                create a tool that transforms the cryptic, chaotic stream of
                network data into a clear, visual, and actionable narrative.
              </p>

                Auralis is more than just a monitoring tool; it's a window into
                your network's soul. Whether you're a developer debugging a
                distributed application, a small business owner ensuring a

                power to see, understand, and take control of your digital
                environment. We believe that with the right insights, anyone can
